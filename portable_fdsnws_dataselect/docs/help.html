    <h1>Portable FDSNWS Dataselect Help</h1>

    <p><a href="index.html">Display Service Interface</a></p>

    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>The <strong>fdsnws-dataselect</strong> service provides access to time series data for specified channels and time ranges.</p>

    <p>Data are selected using <a href="http://ds.iris.edu/ds/nodes/dmc/data/formats/seed/">SEED</a> time series identifiers (network, station, location &amp; channel) in addition to time ranges.  Data are returned in <a href="http://ds.iris.edu/ds/nodes/dmc/data/formats/seed/">miniSEED</a> format.</p>

    <p>This service is an implementation of the <a href="http://www.fdsn.org/webservices/">FDSN web service specification</a> version 1.</p>

    <p>To retrieve raw waveform data in miniSEED format, submit a request by either of two methods:
      <ul>
	<li><em>via HTTP GET</em> : Provide a series of parameter-value pairs in the URL that specify the start-time and end-time, along with the desired network(s), station(s), location(s) and  channel(s) . Wildcards are supported.  Please visit the fdsnws-dataselect service interface for parameter usage details.</li>
	<li><em>via HTTP POST</em>: Submit a pre-formatted request (e.g. a file) to the service containing a list of the desired networks, stations, locations, channels, start-times and end-times.  The POSTing method is described in more detail on this page.</li>
    </ul></p>

    <p>This service is designed to handle very large data requests<sup class="footnote" id="fnrevd72c989c9e10401bb1ce9bf0037707c9"><a href="#fnd72c989c9e10401bb1ce9bf0037707c9">1</a></sup> and can easily be used with command line programs such as wget, curl or similar utilities.</p>

    <h2 id="dataselection">Data selection</h2>

    <p>A data selection is composed of a list of network, station, location, channel, start time and end time entries. Channel codes follow the conventions documented in <a href="http://www.fdsn.org/seed_manual/SEEDManual_V2.4_Appendix-A.pdf">Appendix A</a> of the <span class="caps">SEED</span> Manual.  The IRIS DMC has reproduced the appendix for an accessible <a href="http://ds.iris.edu/ds/nodes/dmc/data/formats/seed-channel-naming/">SEED channel naming refrence</a>.</p>

	  <p>Optional parameters that may be specified:
	    <ul>
        <li>'quality': SEED quality/version, selection of a specific SEED data quality code (defaults to &#8220;best&#8221;)</li>
        <li>'nodata': HTTP response status when no data is available, can be &#8220;204&#8221; or &#8220;404&#8221; (defaults to &#8220;204&#8221;)</li>
        <li>'format': Data format for response, only &#8220;miniseed&#8221; is allowed.</li>
        <!-- These options are not yet supported
    	  <li>Minimum segment length, limit data return to segments longer than a specified value</li>
	      <li>Longest segment only, limit data return to the longest segment per channel</li>
        -->
	    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>An example selection, submitted using HTTP POST, might look like:</p>

<pre>TA A25A -- BHZ 2010-03-25T00:00:00 2010-04-01T00:00:00
IU ANMO * BH? 2010-03-25T00:00:00 2010-04-01T00:00:00
IU ANMO 10 HHZ 2010-03-25T00:00:00 2010-04-01T00:00:00
II KURK 00 BHN 2010-03-25T00:00:00 2010-04-01T00:00:00</pre>

    <ul>
      <li>Glob expressions (wildcards) are allowed in all identifier fields, use <b>*</b> in the time fields for open.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>wget example</h2>

    <p>Requests can be made with a selection file and the <code>wget</code> Unix command line utility.</p>

<pre>$ cat waveform.request
quality=B
TA A25A -- BHZ 2010-03-25T00:00:00 2010-04-01T00:00:00
TA A25A -- BHE 2010-03-25T00:00:00 2010-04-01T00:00:00</pre>

    <pre>$ wget --post-file=waveform.request -O TA.miniseed http://server.local:port/fdsnws/dataselect/1/query</pre>

    <p>The "server.local" and "port" should be adjusted to the location of the local service.</p>

    <p>This will send the request to the server and save the results in a file name TA.miniseed</p>

    <h2>cURL example</h2>

    <p>Requests can also be made with a selection file and the <code>curl</code> Unix command line utility.</p>

<pre>$ cat waveform.request
quality=B
TA A25A -- BHZ 2010-03-25T00:00:00 2010-04-01T00:00:00
TA A25A -- BHE 2010-03-25T00:00:00 2010-04-01T00:00:00</pre>

    <pre>$ curl -L --data-binary @waveform.request -o TA.miniseed http://server.local:port/fdsnws/dataselect/1/query</pre>

    <p>The "server.local" and "port" should be adjusted to the location of the local service.</p>

    <p>Here is the equivalent request using <em>query parameters</em> instead of a selection file&#8230;</p>

    <pre>$ curl -L -o TA.miniseed &#34;http://server.local:port/fdsnws/dataselect/1/query?net=TA&amp;sta=A25A&amp;cha=BHZ,BHE&amp;loc=--&amp;starttime=2010-03-25&amp;endtime=2010-04-01&#34;</pre>

    <p>This will send the request to the server and save the results in a file name TA.miniseed</p>

    <p>We recommend always using the <code>-L</code> option to allow curl to follow HTTP redirections specified by our systems.  The DMC uses HTTP redirection during maintenance to keep servicing requests.</p>

    <p>You may wish to use the <code>-f</code> option. This will cause curl to return an exit code of 22 if data is not found or the request is improperly formatted.</p>

    <p>See http://curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html for more information.</p>

    <h2>Working with miniSEED</h2>

    <p>A variety of software tools are available from the DMC to assist with organizing and viewing miniSEED data or converting it to another format.  Detailed descriptions and usage examples for each piece of software can be found by clicking the links below.  </p>

    <h2 id="restricteddata">Accessing restricted data</h2>

    Restricted access is not implemented in this server.
    <!--
    <p>Requesting restricted data via this web service requires authentication.  The authentication is done using a standard <span class="caps">HTTP</span> mechanism called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digest_access_authentication">digest access authentication</a>, using a 3-way handshake.  To submit a request with authentication credentials you would use the <code>queryauth</code> method of the service in place of the <code>query</code> method.  You must use a client that supports digest authentication, luckily such support is common.  All of the <a href="http://service.iris.edu/clients/"><span class="caps">IRIS</span> <span class="caps">DMC</span>&#8217;s clients</a> support accessing restricted data through digest authentication.</p>

    <p>For example, submitting a request and subsequently initiating the authentication handshake would be done by requesting this <span class="caps">URL</span>:</p>

    <pre>http://server.local:port/fdsnws/dataselect/1/queryauth?net=IU&amp;sta=ANMO&amp;loc=00&amp;cha=BHZ&amp;start=2010-02-27T06:30:00&amp;end=2010-02-27T10:30:00</pre>

    <p>This request could be submitted, along with authentication credentials, using a command line tool like <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/">curl</a>:</p>

    <pre>$ curl -L --digest --user EMAIL:PASSWORD -o data.mseed &#39;http://server.local:port/fdsnws/dataselect/1/queryauth?net=IU&amp;sta=ANMO&amp;loc=0Z&amp;start=2010-02-27T06:30:00&amp;end=2010-02-27T10:30:00&#39;</pre>

    <p>where you replace <code>EMAIL</code> and <code>PASSWORD</code> with your own credentials.  If you are submitting this request from the command line, then for security purposes, you may consider not including <code>PASSWORD</code> in your request, as it is an optional parameter.  If only <code>EMAIL</code> is specified, then curl will prompt you for your password when the request is submitted.</p>

    <h2 id="considerations">Considerations</h2>

    <p class="footnote" id="fnd72c989c9e10401bb1ce9bf0037707c9"><sup>1</sup> In general, it is preferable to not ask for too much data in a single request. Large requests take longer to complete. If a large request fails due to any networking issue, it will have to be resubmitted to be completed. This will cause the entire request to be completely reprocessed and re-transmitted. By breaking large requests into smaller requests, only the smaller pieces will need to be resubmitted and re-transmitted if there is a networking problem. Web service network connections will commonly time out and break after some number of minutes if no data is transmitted.

    <p>Conversly, it is less efficient to ask for too little data in each request. Each time a request is made, a network connection must be established and a request processing unit started. For performance reasons, it is better to group together selections from the same stations and place them in the same request. This is especially true of selections that cover the same time periods.</p>
