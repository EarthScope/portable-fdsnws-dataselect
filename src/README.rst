Portable fdsnws-dataselect
==========================

This is a portable fdsnws-dataselect/1 implementation which will allow a wide 
variety of users to host arbitrary data sets and take advantage of existing 
data selection and collection tools. The system uses a miniSEED data index 
devised by the IRIS DMC and stored in SQLite.
